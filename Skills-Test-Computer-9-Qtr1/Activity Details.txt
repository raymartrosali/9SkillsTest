Caffè Americano (also known as Americano or American; Italian pronunciation: [kaf'f? ameri'ka?no]; Spanish: café americano, literally American coffee) is a type of coffee drink prepared by diluting an espresso with hot water, giving it a similar strength to, but different flavor from, traditionally brewed coffee. The strength of an Americano varies with the number of shots of espresso and the amount of water added. The name is also spelled with varying capitalization and use of diacritics: e.g., café americano.

In Italy, caffè americano could mean either espresso with hot water or filtered coffee (caffè all'americana).

Ingredients: Hot water and espresso
